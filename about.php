				<h1>Author's Profile</h1>
				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>My name is Miguel. I'm a Musician, Programmer and a Photographer. I play various instruments but drums would be my expertise. In Programming, web design coding with PHP and HTML/CSS is my specialty and for Photography, I'm mostly into shoot all but music photography would be my best. I own and created this website out of scratch and I am the person that runs this photography business. I also run the TRM Web Design service that creates websites. I used to play for several bands before, from Church choir, became Alternative, to Ska then to Metal.
				<br/><br/>
				I started Photography during October 2016 when I joined Scott Kelby World-Wide Photowalk in Cebu when I was invited by a co-worker who became our good friend and mentor, it was a Street Photography and that's how I became more interested and fell in love with Photography. See, I've been taking pictures ever since high school using an old Nikon F camera that my step father gave to me. It's the same camera model that the Bang Bang Club moview leading man is using and it's the same camera model that NASA is using during 1960s. Back then I didn't know how to use those lens but damn, I know how to use it, using a light meter device that suggests the correct exposure dial on the camera's dial. Also love the smell of new roll of film, the sound it made when you're out of film, the struggle of unrolling the film and the excitement of waiting for 1-2 weeks for the shop to finish developing your photos. When me and my girlfriend travels, we take photos of anything. Lol!

				<h2>Remarks</h2>
				<p>
				Since the October 2016 SKKWWPW photowalk, I've been introduce to several photography events and activities locally. Joined several photography communities on social media and up to this day, I'm still continously learning and have been trying to improve. I don't have the latest and expensive equipment for my photography but I'll leave the decision for you to decide whether you like my work or not, whether you would hire me or not.
